## Vision

To provide a more inclusive platform than any previously developed protocol, we will build a layered architecture with a single settlement layer main chain and multiple computing layer sidechains. The settlement layer main chain serves main functions of the base currency of the settlement layer and support token issuance on the settlement layer and coins on the computing sidechains. The settlement layer will focus on asset accounting and cross-chain interaction to keep it simple, efficient and secure. The computing layer will work to expand the network technology stack to support multiple underlying chain technologies and smart contract, including but not limited to WASM virtual machine-based EOSIO application chains, EVM virtual machine-based Ethereum application chains, IELE virtual machine-based Cardano chain, zero-knowledge proof-based Zcash chain, etc.

The computing layers adopt different development techniques, analyze advantages and disadvantages of various blockchain technologies to support multiple forms of sidechains. We offer options for application developers instead of confining them to a specific chain so that developers donâ€™t have to pay for overpriced RAM. We work to increase performance of application chains, segregate security risk, and experiment new contract technologies.
